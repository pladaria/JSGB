Javascript GameBoy Emulator

# Notes

This code is very old (2009). 

I think this was the world's first GameBoy emulator written in JavaScript.

By that time JS engines were not as fast as today so the code has lots of "bad practices" to improve speed like almost everything global, loop unrollings, etc.

I will complete this project... Someday.
